        <h1>Summary</h1>
        <p>I'm software engineer with strong experience in computer science. I was participating in many projects as developer and as team leader in such domains as aviation, healthcare, video surveillance, media processing, security systems. I have experience with different programming languages, instruments and services, always learn new technologies in this rapidly growing area. My technical background spans a wide range of languages and frameworks —  from low-level and ultra-low-latency C/C++, to JVM-based languages like Java and Scala, as well as Python for rapid prototyping and AI-powered services. Video processing and streaming is one of my favorite areas of expertise. I have contributed to several projects involving advanced media processing solutions, including the development and optimization of custom video codecs with enhanced performance characteristics. Main interest and expertise: <em>distributed client server systems, VoIP and media processing, media streaming solutions, AI services, LLM, RAG, IoT and embedded systems, cross-platform development</em>.</p>
